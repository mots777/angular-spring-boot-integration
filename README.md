# angular-spring-boot-integration - EDITED
In this personal project I have integrated Angular and Sprint boot to create a Note application with JWT (JSON Web Token) implemented on top of it. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
